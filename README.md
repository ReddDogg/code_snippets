⚠️ **WARNING: Personal Test Repository** ⚠️

This is a personal repository for code snippets and experiments. This repo contains:

- Random test code and experiments
- Junk code used for local development testing
- Backup and source control for my local code tests

**DO NOT USE THIS CODE FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN DEVELOPMENT TESTING**

- ❌ Never use in production
- ❌ Code quality is intentionally poor
- ❌ No guarantees, no support, no best practices

This is purely a personal scratchpad for backing up throwaway code.
